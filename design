Configuration

    The default location of the qtile config file is:
        
        ~/.qtile/config.py

    This file usually imports libqtile, and then instantiates various objects.

    Key(["control"], "k", "function", 1, 3=foo)
    Key(["control"], "k", "function2", 1, 3=foo)
    Key(["control"], "k", "function3", 1, 3=foo)

    Groups track the following information:
        - An ordered list of clients.
