Groups
    
    Groups track the following information:
        - An ordered list of clients.
        - A pointer to the client that currently has focus.

Layouts 

    Operate on groups.

        max
        
            The window that has focus occupies the full screen. All other
            windows are hidden.

        float
        
            All windows are floating.

        twopane

            Windows are laid out in two panes, with one window being a
            nominated master. The master is always displayed, other windows are
            in a "stack" in the other pane.
            
            Operations:

                promote: Promote the currently focused window to master.

        tile

            Windows are tiled into X colums, each with Y rows. 

            Operations:

                xset: Set number of columns.
                yset: Set number of rows.
                xinc: Increment columns.
                xdec: Decrement columns.
