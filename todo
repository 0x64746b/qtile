BUGS

- simulate_keypress doesn't seem to work from qsh at the moment.


FEATURES

- Obey window size hints, to the extent where we don't make windows larger than
  the requested size. We must, however, make windows smaller if needs be, to
  fit in with the layout.
- We need a function that checks a configuration file for obvious errors. This
  will be used to sanity-check config before a manager restart is triggered.
- We need a mechanism for saving WM running state to window properties, and
  re-reading this on restart.
- A nice way to navigate groups and screens in qsh. Essentially, a porcelain
  layer on top of our base command set.
- A way to send qsh output to a pager (maybe pipe to shell functionality, so
  the user can go "log | less"?).
- Split and unsplit a Stack layout stack vertically.


FUTURE

- Move to a safer object serialisation protocol. Despite the ominous warning
  against un-marshalling untrusted data in the Python docs, I believe that the
  worst an attacker could do is cause the interpreter to crash. None the less,
  since we're using marshalled data pretty much everywhere, we should find an
  obviously safe protocol. One option:
