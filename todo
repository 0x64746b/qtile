BUGS

- simulate_keypress doesn't seem to work from qsh at the moment.


FEATURES

- Obey window size hints, to the extent where we don't make windows larger than
  the requested size. We must, however, make windows smaller if needs be, to
  fit in with the layout.
- Stack layout windows need borders to indicate the current window.
- We need a function that checks a configuration file for obvious errors. This
  will be used to sanity-check config before a manager restart is triggered.
- We need a mechanism for saving WM running state to window properties, and
  re-reading this on restart.
- A nice way if inspecting detailed window configuration from qsh.
- A nice way to navigate groups and screens in qsh.
- A way to send qsh output to a pager (maybe pipe to shell functionality, so
  the user can go "log | less"?).
