Dependencies
------------

Qtile depends on recent repository checkouts of xpyb and pycairo. More
instructions on building and installing these can be found in the documentation
on www.qtile.org.


Installation
------------

1 - Install the Qtile library and executables:

        python setup.py install

2 - Create a Qtile configuration directory and create a configuration file. It
    is probably easiest to start with one of the configuration files in the
    examples/config directory of the Qtile distribution:

        mkdir ~/.config/qtile

        cp examples/config/cortesi-config.py ~/.config/qtile/config.py

3 - Make Qtile run. On my system, this meant creating an .xsession file
    containing the following:

#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/bin/qtile
