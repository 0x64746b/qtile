Gap
===

Gaps are empty spaces associated with a specific screen. Each gap is placed at
a specific screen position - top, bottom, left or right.



Bar
===

Bars don't expose much functionality themselves, acting instead simply as
containers for @!aLink("widgets.html", "Widgets")!@. Bars can only be placed at
the top or bottom of a screen.
