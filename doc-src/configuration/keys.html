The __keys__ variable defines Qtile's key bindings. 

# libqtile.manager.Key

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
class Key:
    def __init__(self, modifiers, key, *commands):
<!--(end)-->

- __modifiers__: A list of modifier specifications. Modifier
specifications are one of: "shift", "lock", "control", "mod1",
"mod2", "mod3", "mod4", "mod5".
- __key__: A key specification, e.g. "a", "Tab", "Return", "space".
- __*commands__: A list of lazy command objects generated with the command.lazy
helper. If multiple Call objects are specified, they are run in sequence.


# The command.lazy object

__command.lazy__ is a special helper object to specify a command for later
execution. This object acts like the root of the object graph, which means that
we can specify a key binding command with the same syntax used to call the
command through a script or through [qsh](@!urlTo("qsh.html")!@).


# Example

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
keys = [
    Key(
        ["mod1"], "k",
        command.lazy.layout.down()
    ),
    Key(
        ["mod1"], "j",
        lazy.layout.up()
    )
]
<!--(end)-->

On my system __mod1__ is the Alt key - you can see which modifiers map to which
keys on your system by running the __xmodmap__ command. This example binds
__Alt-k__ to the "down" command on the current layout. This command is standard
on all the included layouts, and switches to the next window (where "next" is
defined differently in different layouts). The matching "up" command switches
to the previous window.
