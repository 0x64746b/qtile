Qtile has an extensive set of hooks that users can bind functions to. Be
careful when writing hooks - they run in the context of the Qtile process, and
have complete access to all of Qtile's internal object APIs. This means they
can be arbitrarily powerful, but they can also crash Qtile or corrupt its data
structures.

Normally, hooks are subscribed to in the Qtile configuration file. Hooks are
exposed on the __hook.subscribe__ object. The following code will print the
client name to stderr (which will show up in your .xsession-errors file)
whenever focus changes.

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
from libqtile import hook

def mymethod(c):
    print >> sys.stderr, c.name

hook.subscribe.client_focus(mymethod)
<!--(end)-->

$!hookobj("libqtile.hook.Subscribe")!$
