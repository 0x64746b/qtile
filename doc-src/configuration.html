Qtile is configured in Python. A script (~/.qtile/config.py by default) is
evaluated, and a small set of configuration variables - __keys__, __groups__,
__layouts__ and __screens__ - are pulled from its global namespace. Each of
these variables are described below, and a full configuration example can be
found @!aLink("configuration/example.html", "here")!@. There are also a number
of example configurations in the __examples__ directory of the source
distribution.


keys
====

    A list of __libqtile.manager.Key__ objects.

    $!qtgrok("manager.Key").signatureDoc()!$

    The signature for __libqtile.command.Call__ objects is as follows:
    
    $!qtgrok("command.Call").signatureDoc()!$

    A complete list of commands can be found in the @!linkTo("commands.html")!@
    section of this manual.
      

groups
======

    A list of strings specifying group names.


layouts
=======

    A list of layout objects. For now, Qtile only has a single (quite powerful)
    layout - __libqtile.layout.stack.Stack__ - but this will change soon.

    $!qtgrok("layout.stack.Stack").signatureDoc()!$


screens
=======

    A list of __libqtile.manager.Screen__ objects.

    $!qtgrok("manager.Screen").signatureDoc()!$
