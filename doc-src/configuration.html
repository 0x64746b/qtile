Qtile is configured in Python. A script (~/.qtile/config.py by default) is
evaluated, and a small set of configuration variables - __keys__, __groups__,
__layouts__ and __screens__ - are pulled from its global namespace. Each of
these variables are described below, and a full configuration example can be
found @!aLink("configuration/example.html", "here")!@. There are also a number
of example configurations in the __examples__ directory of the source
distribution.
