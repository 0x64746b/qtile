Qtile is configured in Python. A script (~/.qtile/config.py by default) is
evaluated, and a small set of configuration variables (groups,
@!linkTo("keys.html")!@, @!linkTo("layouts.html")!@, and
@!linkTo("screens.html")!@) are pulled from its global namespace. 

# Variables

## @!linkTo("groups.html")!@

A list of __libqtile.manager.Group__ objects which defines the group names.

## @!linkTo("keys.html")!@

A list of __libqtile.manager.Key__ objects which defines the keybindings. At a
minimum, this will probably include bindings to switch between windows, groups
and layouts.

## @!linkTo("layouts.html")!@

A list layout objects, configuring the layouts you want to use.


## @!linkTo("mouse.html")!@

A list of __libqtile.manager.Drag__ and __libqtile.manager.Click__ objects
defining mouse operations.


## @!linkTo("screens.html")!@

A list of __libqtile.manager.Screen__ objects, which defines the physical
screens you want to use, and the bars and widgets associated with them. Most of
the visible "look and feel" configuration will happen in this section.
