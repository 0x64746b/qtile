Qtile is configured in Python. A script is evaluated (~/.qtile/config.py by
default), and a set of configuration variables is pulled from its global
namespace. 


keys
====

    A list of __libqtile.Key__ objects:

    $!qtgrok("manager.Key").signatureDoc()!$

    The signature for __Call__ objects is as follows:
    
    $!qtgrok("command.Call").signatureDoc()!$

    A complete list of commands can be found in the @!linkTo("ipc.html")!@
    section of this manual.
      

groups
======

    A list of group name strings.


layouts
=======

    A list of Qtile layout objects. For now, Qtile only has a single (quite
    powerful) layout called __Stack__, but this will change soon:

    $!qtgrok("layout.Stack").signatureDoc()!$


screens
=======

    A list of libqtile.Screen objects:

    $!qtgrok("manager.Screen").signatureDoc()!$
