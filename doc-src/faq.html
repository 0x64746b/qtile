When I open a full-screen page in Firefox, the bottom of the Firefox window seems to extend beyond the limits of the screen. What gives?
-----

It seems that Firefox does not comply with the recommendations of ICCCM when it
requests full-screen mode. Firefox sends us a ConfigureRequest notification to
request full-screen mode. We configure the window with the appropriate tiled
size (which is less than full-screen), and send the window a ConfigureNotify to
let it know. Firefox then merrily ignores our ConfigureNotify, and assumes that
it's been resized to fill the screen. If you know if a way around this, let us
know.


When I open an instance of xterm/urxvt/rxvt containing an instance of Vim, I see text and layout corruption. What gives?
-----

This is Vim not handling terminal resizes correctly. You can fix this by
starting your xterm with the "-wf" option, like so:

<pre>
 xterm -wf -e vim
</pre>
