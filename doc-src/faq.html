When I open a full-screen page in Firefox, the the Firefox window seems to extend beyond the limits of the screen. What gives?
-----

It seems that Firefox does not comply with the recommendations of ICCCM when it
requests full-screen mode. Firefox sends us a ConfigureRequest notification to
request full-screen mode. We configure the window with the appropriate tiled
size (which is less than full-screen), and send the window a ConfigureNotify to
let it know. Firefox then merrily ignores our ConfigureNotify, and assumes that
it's been resized to fill the screen. If you know if a way around this, let me
know.


When I first start xterm/urxvt/rxvt containing an instance of Vim, I see text and layout corruption. What gives?
-----

Vim is not handling terminal resizes correctly. You can fix the probelm by
starting your xterm with the "-wf" option, like so:

<pre>
 xterm -wf -e vim
</pre>


How do I know which modifier specification maps to which key?
-------------------------------------------------------------

To see a list of modifier names and their matching keys, use the __xmodmap__
command. On my system, the output looks like this:

<pre>
> xmodmap 
xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x9)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3      
mod4        Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)
mod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)
</pre>
