__Qtile is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager written in Python.__

Features
========

* Simple, small and extensible. It's easy to write your own layouts,
  widgets and built-in commands.
* Configured entirely in Python. 
* Command-line shell that allows all aspects of Qtile to be manipulated and inspected.
* Complete remote scriptability - write scripts to set up workspaces,
  manipulate windows, update status bar widgets and more.
* Qtile's scriptability has made thorough unit testing possible,
  making it one of the best-tested window managers around.


Dependencies
============

Qtile relies on some cutting-edge features in PyCairo, XCB, and xpyb. Until the
latest versions of these projects make it into distros, it's best to use recent
checkouts from their repositories. Here's a brief step-by-step guide:


xpyb
----

Edit configure.ac, change version from 1.2 to 1.3.

    mkdir m4
    ./configure --disable-drm2
    make
    sudo make install


cairo
-----

    ./configure --enable-xcb
    make
    sudo make install


py2cairo
--------

    ./configure

Check that XPYB is correctly detected.

    make
    sudo make install


If you plan to run the test suite, you will also need <a
