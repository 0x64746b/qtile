Qtile's public API consists of a hierarchy of nodes, each with a set of
associated commands. The same API serves a number of different purposes:

    - Commands can be bound to keys in the Qtile configuration file. 
    - Commands can be called manually through __qsh__, the Qtile shell.
    - Commands can be called to interact with Qtile from a script. 

Please explore the API using __qsh__ - command lists and detailed documentation
can be accessed from its built-in help command, and are not documented here.


Object Hierarchy
================

    Qtile's object hierarchy consists of seven node types: __layout__,
    __window__, __group__, __bar__, __widget__, __screen__, and a special root
    node that lies at the top of the tree. Each node has a set of associated
    commands, a set of children, and a set of keys.  This is what the hierarchy
    looks like at a high level:

<pre>
root
    bar
        screen
    group
        layout
        screen
        window
    layout
        group
        screen
        window
    screen
        bar
        layout
        window
    widget
        bar
        group
        screen
    window
        group
        screen
        layout
</pre>

    Lets start with a simple example. The following script runs the __status__
    command on the root node of the command tree (which, in this case, is the
    Client object):

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
from libqtile.command import Client
c = Client()
print c.status()
<!--(end)-->

    Children are exposed as attributes on each node, so we can access the
    "info" command on the group child node like so:

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
c.group.info()
<!--(end)-->

    In the example above, __c.group__ specifies the _current_ group. To access
    a specific group, regardless of whether or not it is current, we use the
    Python containment syntax:

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
c.group["b"].info()
<!--(end)-->

    The current __group__, __layout__, __screen__ and __window__ can be
    accessed by simply leaving the key specifier out. The key specifier is
    mandatory for __widget__ and __bar__ nodes. 

    We can now drill down deeper in the hierarchy. To access the screen
    currently displaying group "b", we can do this:

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
c.group["b"].screen.info()
<!--(end)-->
   
    Be aware, however, that group "b" might not currently be displayed. In that
    case, it has no associated screen, the path resolves to a non-existent
    node, and we get an exeption:

<pre>
libqtile.command.CommandError: No object screen in path 'group['b'].screen'
</pre>

    The hierarchy is not a tree, since it can contain cycles. This path
    (redundantly) specifies the group belonging to the screen that belongs to
    group "b":

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
c.group["b"].screen.group()
<!--(end)-->

Keys 
====

The key specifier for the various object types are as follows:


<table>

    <th> Object </th>
    <th> Key </th>
    <th> Optional? </th>
    <th> Example </th>

    <tr> 
        <td> bar </td>
        <td> One of "top", "bottom", "left", "right" </td>
        <td> No </td>
        <td> c.screen.bar["bottom"] </td>
    </tr>

    <tr> 
        <td> group </td>
        <td> Name string </td>
        <td> Yes </td>
        <td> c.group["one"] </td>
    </tr>

    <tr> 
        <td> layout </td>
        <td> Integer offset </td>
        <td> Yes </td>
        <td> c.layout[2] </td>
    </tr>

    <tr> 
        <td> screen </td>
        <td> Integer offset </td>
        <td> Yes </td>
        <td> c.screen[1] </td>
    </tr>

    <tr> 
        <td> widget </td>
        <td> Widget name </td>
        <td> No </td>
        <td> c.widget["textbox"] </td>
    </tr>

    <tr> 
        <td> window </td>
        <td> Integer window ID </td>
        <td> Yes </td>
        <td> c.window[123456] </td>
    </tr>

</table>
