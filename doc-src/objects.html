Qtile's public API consists of a graph of objects, where each object has a set
of associated commands. Object commands are used for a number of different
purposes:

- Commands can be bound to keys in the Qtile configuration file. 
- Commands can be called manually through __qsh__, the Qtile shell.
- Commands can be called to interact with Qtile from a script. 

If the explanation below seems a bit complex, please take a moment to explore
the API using the __qsh__ command shell. Command lists and detailed
documentation can be accessed from its built-in help command, and are not
documented here.


Object Graph
============

The objects in Qtile's object graph come in seven flavours, matching the seven
basic components of the window manager: __layout__, __window__, __group__,
__bar__, __widget__, __screen__, and a special __root__ node.  Objects are
addressed by a path specification that starts at the root, and follows the
edges of the graph. This is what the graph looks like:

<center>
<img src="objgraph.png">
</center>
    
Each arrow can be read as "holds a reference to". So, we can see that a
__widget__ object _holds a reference to_ objects of type __bar__, __screen__
and __group__. Lets start with some simple examples of how the addressing
works. The following script runs the __status__ command on the root node of the
command graph (which, in this case, is represented by the Client object):

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
from libqtile.command import Client
c = Client()
print c.status()
<!--(end)-->

From the graph, we can see that the root node holds a reference to
__group__ nodes. We can access the "info" command on the current group like
so:

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
c.group.info()
<!--(end)-->

To access a specific group, regardless of whether or not it is current, we
use the Python containment syntax:

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
c.group["b"].info()
<!--(end)-->

The current __group__, __layout__, __screen__ and __window__ can be
accessed by simply leaving the key specifier out. The key specifier is
mandatory for __widget__ and __bar__ nodes. 

We can now drill down deeper in the graph. To access the screen
currently displaying group "b", we can do this:

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
c.group["b"].screen.info()
<!--(end)-->
   
Be aware, however, that group "b" might not currently be displayed. In that
case, it has no associated screen, the path resolves to a non-existent
node, and we get an exeption:

<pre>
libqtile.command.CommandError: No object screen in path 'group['b'].screen'
</pre>

The graph is not a tree, since it can contain cycles. This path (redundantly)
specifies the group belonging to the screen that belongs to group "b":

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
c.group["b"].screen.group()
<!--(end)-->

Keys 
====

The key specifier for the various object types are as follows:


<table>

    <th> Object </th>
    <th> Key </th>
    <th> Optional? </th>
    <th> Example </th>

    <tr> 
        <td> bar </td>
        <td> "top", "bottom" </td>
        <td> No </td>
        <td> c.screen.bar["bottom"] </td>
    </tr>

    <tr> 
        <td> group </td>
        <td> Name string </td>
        <td> Yes </td>
        <td> 
            c.group["one"] <br>
            c.group
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr> 
        <td> layout </td>
        <td> Integer offset </td>
        <td> Yes </td>
        <td> 
            c.layout[2] <br>
            c.layout
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr> 
        <td> screen </td>
        <td> Integer offset </td>
        <td> Yes </td>
        <td> 
            c.screen[1] <br>
            c.screen
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr> 
        <td> widget </td>
        <td> Widget name </td>
        <td> No </td>
        <td> c.widget["textbox"] </td>
    </tr>

    <tr> 
        <td> window </td>
        <td> Integer window ID </td>
        <td> Yes </td>
        <td> 
            c.window[123456]  <br>
            c.window
        </td>
    </tr>
