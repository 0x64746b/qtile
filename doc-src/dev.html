Using Xephyr and the test suite
===============================

Qtile has a very extensive test suite, using the Xephyr nested X server. When
tests are run, a nested X server with a nested instance of Qtile is fired up,
and then tests interact with the Qtile instance through the client API. The
fact that we can do this is a great demonstration of just how completely
scriptable Qtile is. In fact, Qtile is designed expressly to be scriptable
enough to allow unit testing in a nested environment.

The Qtile repo includes a tiny helper script to let you quickly pull up a
nested instance instance of Qtile in Xephyr, using your current configuration.
Run it from the top-level of the repository, like this:

<pre>
    ./test/scripts/xephyr                      
</pre>

In practice, the development cyclce looks something like this:

<ol>

    <li> make minor code change                         
    <li> run appropriate test: <strong>pry ./test_module.uMySuite</strong>
    <li> GOTO 1, until hackage is complete
    <li> run entire test suite: <strong>pry</strong> 
    <li> commit                                  

</ol>
