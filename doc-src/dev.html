Using Xnest and the test suite
==============================

The easiest way to hack on Qtile in comfort, is to use a nested X server like
XNest or Xephyr. The Qtile repo includes a tiny helper script to let you
quickly pull up a nested instance instance of Qtile in Xnest, using your
current configuration. Run it from the top-level of the repository, like this:

<pre>
    ./test/scripts/xnest                      
</pre>

During development, however, the Xnest instance is usually started up by the
Qtile test suite. Qtile is designed expressly to have enough scriptability to
allow a complete set of unit tests to be written. In practice, the development
cyclce looks something like this:

<ol>

    <li> make minor code change                         
    <li> run appropriate test: <strong>pry ./test_module.uMySuite</strong>
    <li> GOTO 1, until hackage is complete
    <li> run entire test suite: <strong>pry</strong> 
    <li> commit                                  

</ol>
