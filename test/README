Dependencies
============

    - Pry unit testing framework, downloadable from:

            http://dev.nullcube.com

    - Xephyr (preferred) or Xnest nested X server.



Running Tests
=============

    After installing the dependencies, do the following (from the top level of
    the qtile tree):
        
        > cd tests
        > pry

    An Xnest instance hosting a test instance of Qtile will appear. Please
    ignore any flickering and flashing windows inside Xnest - this is simply
    the test suite running.

    Note that Pry's coverage analysis will NOT work for the Qtile test suite.
    The test Qtile instance runs as a different process, and Pry does not
    support cross-process coverage analysis (yet).
